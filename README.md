# Redesign Landing Page Project

Welcome to my Qwords x Rakamin Academy Fullstack Developer Final Project repository! This project aims to be the final project of my project-based internship, where participants are tested to create a landing page. This is done to prepare participants when they later have to apply their fullstack developer knowledge in other companies.
